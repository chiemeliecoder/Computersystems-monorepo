Practicum I

The given code covers the requirement to build a program-managed heap that allows programs to allocate memory from that heap. The code defines a struct called block that stores metadata about the allocated blocks of memory, and uses a linked list of block structs to keep track of free memory.

The code also defines a function pm_malloc_lock that allocates memory from the program-managed heap.
