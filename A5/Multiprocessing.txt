I spent the entire night casting spells to bring you back. 

I reached for the last bouquet of flowers you gave me. 

Now wilting in their vase one by one. 

I popped their heads off and ate them. 

I stuffed a towel at the foot of every door leave. 

I told the air i have no use for you. 

I drew every curtain in the house. 

Go I told the light no one is coming in and no one is going out. 

you left and I wanted you still yet. 

I deserved someone who was willing to stay? 

I spend days in bed debilitated by loss. 

I attempt to cry you back but the water is done and still you have not returned? 

I pinch my belly till it bleeds. 

I have lost count of the days sun becomes moon and moon becomes sun. 

I become a ghost! 

A dozen different thoughts tear through me each second. 

You must be on your way perhaps. 

It’s best if you’re not! 

I am okay. 

no, I am angry. 

Yes, I hate you. 

Maybe I can’t move on. 

I will forgive you. 

I want to rip my hair out over and over and over again till my mind exhausts itself into a silence. 

Yesterday the rain tried to imitate my hands by running down your body,

I ripped the sky apart for allowing it, 

The hummingbirds tell me you’ve changed your hair 

I tell them I don’t care while listening to them describe every detail 

I envy the winds who still witness you
