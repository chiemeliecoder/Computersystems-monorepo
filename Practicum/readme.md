Virtual mem
In this continuation, we demonstrate how to allocate and deallocate pages from the virtual memory. The allocate_page() function returns a pointer to a newly allocated page in the virtual memory, and the deallocate_page() function frees the page at the given page number. The strcpy() function is used to copy the string data to the newly allocated page.
